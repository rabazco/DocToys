## What's Happening

### DocToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.1.0.0 - August 2025 Initial release

In this release, we focused on new features, stability, and improvements.

✨**Highlights**
 
 - Multi Tab Text Editor with autosave. Continue your work where you left.
 - DocMaker. Generate documents from a DOCX template and any data source that can be serialized as XML. Our intelligent DocMaker merges official XML tax forms (e.g. Modelo 650) into legally structured Word templates in seconds. Ideal for inheritance declarations and other complex filings, this tool transforms tax data into polished private documents – instantly.
 - Merge multiple PDF documents.
 - Split PDF documents at given pages.

For [v0.2.0.0][github-next-release-work], we'll work on the items below:
